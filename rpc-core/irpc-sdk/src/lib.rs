//! A toolkit for writing clients on the qrpc message bus.  This bus
//! is the backbone of the [qaul.net](https://qaul.net) service
//! ecosystem.  With it you can create applications (called
//! "services") that interact with a `libqaul` instance, and other
//! services on the same message broker.
//!
//! These crate docs describe the API and basic usage.  For an
//! overview of the core concepts of this ecosystem, consult the
//! [contributors manual][manual].
//!
//! Additionally, you can access documentation of the internal
//! utilities by passing "`--features internals`" to your cargo
//! invocation.  These components are exposed via the API either way,
//! but only documented on demand to not clutter the main
//! documentation.
//!
//!
//! [manual]: https://docs.qaul.org/contributors/technical/rpc-layer
//!
//! ## Using this sdk
//!
//! In order to interact with a running [`qrpc-broker`] instance your
//! service needs to register itself and it's capabilities.
//!
//! First your service needs a place to save some state, composing
//! different parts of this sdk together to create an app.
//!
//! You create a [`Service`] and [`RpcSocket`] and connect to the
//! rpc-broker socket.  The first thing you do with this connection is
//! call `register(...)` on the `Service`.  This establishes the
//! connection, the broker saves your service in it's address lookup
//! table, and you get assigned a hash-id to identify you in future
//! interactions.
//!
//! [`qrpc-broker`]: ../qrpc_broker/index.html
//! [`Service`]: ./struct.Service.html
//! [`RpcSocket`]: ./struct.RpcSocket.html
//!
//! ```
//! # async fn foo() -> Result<(), qrpc_sdk::error::RpcError> {
//! use qrpc_sdk::{Service, RpcSocket, default_socket_path};
//!
//! let mut serv = Service::new("com.example.myapp", 1, "A simple app");
//! let (addr, port) = default_socket_path();
//! let sock = RpcSocket::connect(addr, port).await?;
//!
//! serv.register(sock).await?;
//! println!("Service registered! ID: {}", serv.hash_id().unwrap());
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! Next you need to include the client-lib of the component you want
//! to use, and call `connect(...)` on your service with the component
//! initialiser.
//!
//! ```
//! # async fn foo() -> Result<(), qrpc_sdk::error::RpcError> {
//! # use qrpc_sdk::{Service, RpcSocket, default_socket_path};
//! # let mut serv = Service::new("com.example.myapp", 1, "A simple app");
//! # let (addr, port) = default_socket_path();
//! # let sock = RpcSocket::connect(addr, port).await?;
//! # serv.register(sock).await?;
//!
//! // serv.connect(libqaul_rpc::Init).await?;
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! This will establish a connection with the `libqaul` component and
//! verifies it's capability set.  This mechanism is provided by the
//! [`ServiceConnector`].  Your service will also have to implement
//! this mechanism to be usable by other services on the qrpc bus.
//!
//! [`ServiceConnector`]: ./trait.ServiceConnector.html
//!
//! After that you can call functions on the public API type of the
//! component.  You can get a copy of it via your service handle.
//!
//! ```
//! # async fn foo() -> Result<(), qrpc_sdk::error::RpcError> {
//! # use qrpc_sdk::{Service, RpcSocket, default_socket_path};
//! # let mut serv = Service::new("com.example.myapp", 1, "A simple app");
//! # let (addr, port) = default_socket_path();
//! # let sock = RpcSocket::connect(addr, port).await?;
//! # serv.register(sock).await?;
//!
//! // net.qaul.libqaul is exposed as libqaul_rpc.COMP_ID
//! // let users = serv.component("net.qaul.libqaul").list_users().await?;
//! // println!("Available users: {:?}", users);
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! If you want to see a minimal example of the smallest functional
//! service, see the [`ping`] crate.
