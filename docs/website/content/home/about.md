Introduction_Title: What is irdest?
Introduction: |

    **Irdest** is a research project that aims to create tools for the
    next internet.  These tools allow devices like laptops and
    smartphones to create dynamic **mesh networks** over Bluetooth and
    direct WiFi connections, rather than relying on internet access
    via a mobile network.  This **decentralised and open network**
    extends across any irdest-enabled device, so that if two people
    aren't close enough to each other for their devices to connect
    directly, data can be sent via other devices in the middle,
    without those devices being able to read or change the messages
    passing through it.

    The main component of Irdest is **Ratman**, a decentralised and
    peer-to-peer packet router.  Ratman provides applications with a
    simple API to interact with a mesh network, without having to
    solve a lot of complicated routing problems, or configuring large
    amount of software.  In the backend Ratman connects to other
    Ratman instances via network channel specific drivers, which
    allows the network to grow easily across network boundaries.

Meshing_Title: What is a mesh network?
Meshing: |
    In traditional network infrastructure there is a centralised point
    between you and the Internet: your Internet service provider (ISP).
    Whether you're using a  mobile network tower or a broadband connection,
    your access to the Internet is controlled by a central authority.  This
    means that a entity can monitor or censor your internet traffic.

    In a mesh network there is no network owner. Instead, every user's devices
    link together directly to create a new network where data can flow
    without regulation or control.

    To create these connections, devices can use a variety of methods,
    such as WiFi and Bluetooth, or plain network cables to create links
    with other irdest users around them.

    The network that is created by irdest can serve two purposes:
    to connect you with people around you to run applications specifically
    made for irdest, or to act as a tunnel to the traditional Internet.
