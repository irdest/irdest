# About qaul.net

**qaul.net implements a redundant, open communication principle, in which 
wireless-enabled computers and mobile devices can directly form a 
spontaneous network. Text messaging, file sharing and voice calls are 
possible independent of internet and cellular networks. Qaul.net can 
spread like a virus, and an Open Source Community can modify it 
freely.**

In a time of communication blackouts in places like Egypt, Burma, and 
Tibet, and given the large power outages often caused by natural 
disasters, qaul.net has taken on the challenge of critically examining 
existing communication pathways while simultaneously exploring new 
horizons.

## Promise

Riots in Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Libya, Bahrain, Iran and China. We are 
witnessing a major revolution. Compromising the freedom of speech and 
information will bring about further reductions in political and social 
freedoms.

People in Europe and the United States are monitoring both the 
revolutionary events in Arab, Asian and North African countries as well 
as the dramatic disasters in Japan or Hawaii in close-to real time.


## Twitter Revolution

Are we experiencing a Twitter revolution? The transgressive freedom of 
speech and freedom of information by digital means of communication is 
an epochal achievement. Each new media outlet and social network opens 
up new forms of participation, new angles and perspectives. Each form 
of communication technology shapes the content and introduces specific 
characteristics. Even Twitter and Facebook have boundaries. 


## Communication Conditions

Online platforms are not necessarily political-revolutionary, and also 
have a dubious reputation. YouTube dams the traffic in Asia and Africa, 
Facebook erased the Egyptian Internet activist sites Khaled Said and 
Mohammed El-Baradei in November 2010, and even Google consistently 
cooperates with authorities and oppressors around the world.

## Blackout

The dramatic climax of the protests in Cairo occurred on January 28th, 
2011, when all Internet and mobile phone connections were completely 
shut-down for six full days. The nation's authorities were terrified of 
their people communicating digitally. But despite the digital 
shut-downs, the protests grew bigger anyhow.

At the same time one could sense the distance between the people who 
dared to advance on the streets of Cairo, and an Internet spectatorship 
that persuaded itself to support a revolution by mouse-click. During 
that dramatic upheaval the spectators didn't matter. They were excluded 
again, as in previous Internet Crack Downs, such as those in Myanmar in 
September of 2007, in Tibet in March of 2008, in Iran in June of 2009, 
in the Uighur territories in July of 2009, and in Libya in March of 
2011.


## Dependence

The atrocious earthquakes in Haiti on January 12th, 2010 or in Japan on 
March 11th, 2011 also paint a bleak picture. These natural disasters 
demonstrate the dramatic vulnerability of our communication society. 
Despite the existence of a plethora of communication devices, people 
experiencing the greatest emergencies are often unable to send out 
cries for help. Many cellular antennas lose service, and remaining 
networks become overburdened.


## The Dream of a Free Network

The simple, automatic network communication for everyone has repeatedly 
been announced and advertised. However, only solutions for specific 
devices or proprietary, server-based applications have been realized to 
date.

Wireless mesh network technologies have been popular since 2000, and 
have continuously been the subject of research. With OLSR (Open Link 
State Routing), a mesh network routing protocol as an experimental RFC 
(Request for Comment, standardization procedures) was published in 
2003. Based on this, several implementations followed, including one by 
the U.S. Navy. In recent years, Ad-Hoc mode has become better supported 
by the wireless card.

All these applications and software solutions require some amount of 
configuration and offer only partial functionality. The existing mesh 
networking communities ( 'Freifunk' / 'Funkfeuer' ) separate their 
network from the applications. Although they provide technical 
possibilities and concepts, the dissemination of information fails due 
to time spent on configuration, the lack of conventions/standards, and 
often a lack of know-how. Self-networking becomes a exhausting hassle 
that is due to the growing list of commercial solutions &amp; suppliers 
no longer relevant.

{{< figure src="freifunk-funkfeuer.svg" caption="'Freifunk' / 'Funkfeuer' are open wireless networks. They need separate software from the user, and specific programs to run on certain routers" >}}

{{< figure src="OLPC-web.svg" caption="The aid project One Laptop Per Child can build mesh networks, but the networks are limited to specific devices." >}}


## Caught in the Net

Industry and network operators often use their positions to create new, 
locked-down systems - as seen in recent years. The AppStore, for 
example, has been forcing developers and users of the iPhone, iPod 
and/or iPad down a path of an Apple-regulated, fee-based distribution 
system since 2008. The mobile device manufacturers and network 
operators in particular have worked for a long time to suppress cheaper 
or competing communications services. 

qaul.net is pursuing other approaches and making a 
provider-independent, self-configuring communication-network available 
to all applicable devices: Network and operation become one.

{{< figure src="qaul-mesh-blue.svg" caption="qaul.net connects different wireless devices directly to the mesh network, it works therefore without a mobile telephony and server. " >}}


## Call for freedom

The term qaul is Arabic and means opinion, say, talk or word. Qaul is 
pronounced like the English word 'call'. 

qaul.net reflects and implements the individual and social design 
options in the digital age in an exemplary way. It creates a basis to 
build proper tools to jointly acquire new experiences and new 
insights.

>Movement (2009) to an online audience that followed tweets, Facebook 
>posts, and web videos avidly, hungry for news from the front lines of

>pictures green in solidarity with the activists, and hundreds set up 
>proxy servers to help Iranians evade Internet filters. For users of

## Everywhere and at all Times

A download of the software qaul.net on wireless-enabled computers, 
tablets and mobile phones is sufficient in order to participate. The 
structure of the network and the exchange are managed directly by the 
tool qaul.net: the software is passed from device to device via a WLAN 
like a virus. Computers within range can be connected through qaul.net 
and thereby make the connection to the mesh network. Anyone with a 
Wi-Fi enabled device can expand or consolidate an existing network, or 
create their own.

The community project 'Freifunk' / 'Funkfeuer' and the aid program 
'One Laptop per Child' use a mesh network. qaul.net takes these 
developments further by combining the server and router software with 
the applications on the devices themselves. Event the access to the 
network is no longer tied to a central entity, so the network can 
spread as quickly and easily as a virus.


## Participation in the Network

qaul.net is different because it does not distinguish the difference 
between a parent network, the infrastructure, and the individual use of 
the function. In the qaul.net, every device is part of the network, 
while it is at the same time working as a functional input and 
reception tool. The application software is directly coupled with the 
server and router software. Instead of functioning with only certain 
brands or systems, qaul.net establishes ONE network between ALL kind of 
wireless devices. 

{{< figure src="qaul-GUI.png" caption="Voice calls, file sharing, Twitter like messenger. An open API will invite programmers to write own applications." >}}


## Open Source

The software stays under the GPL (Gnu Public License). This 
'viral' open-source software license guarantees permanent, 
free availability of the software and its further developments and 
improvements. A community of developers shall be built for the purpose 
of maintaining, modifying, and enhancing the software.


## Range

Wi-Fi routers today build a very dense network. In most cities, it is 
common to find more than a dozen strong signals. The record of a direct 
wireless connection was an astonishing distance of 300 km. Therefore 
two customary routers were equipped with improvised directional 
antennas. Such forms of a bridge would also be conceivable for 
qaul.net, and the network could be expanded almost indefinitely. 

But the primary focus is on the neighborhood and the collaborative. 
qaul.net should not primarily connect routers, but should directly 
connect the individual computers and mobile devices. This allows the 
network to become denser, and spontaneous networks between different 
devices can be established at any time.

{{< figure src="distance.svg" caption="Popular WLAN routers connected over a record distance of 300km. Connections between portable devices manage to bridge 40m. This distance can be augmented with sticks, routers and antennas." >}}


## Distribution

qaul.net is passed on like a virus. The users gain access via a wifi 
devise. Those who choose to access receive through this link the 
directly installable software, and can then use qaul.net immediately 
and simultaneously pass access along to others. 

{{< figure src="viral-spreading.svg" caption="The program is passed on like a virus: from user to user. When a new user discovers a wifi qaul.net access one can download the software from this very connection. After the installation one can use it immediately, and pass it on to others. qaul.net interconnects computers and mobile devices via wifi, and overturns the division into infrastructure and use." >}}


## Community

qaul.net offers an alternative to expensive or faulty infrastructures. 
Extensions are possible as a messenger service, and also as a working 
or learning tool. In case of failure of the internet system, qaul.net 
can provide a communication tool that is spreading around the 
neighborhood. qaul.net sensitizes for the conditions and constraints of 
the infrastructure – even if just playfully used –and provides an 
incentive to try new forms of networking.


## New Modes of Action and Reflection

We reached the age of constructive and collaborative culture techniques 
long ago. Individual views are shaped by the conditions of 
communication. Our dependence, however, is hardly realized until we are 
suddenly trapped and isolated in a blackout.

**qaul.net allows us to look behind the curtain and to explore the 
realm beyond the existing ranges and horizons.**


## Tools for the Next Revolution

Individual independence and a personal perspective are a prerequisit 
for a critique of the political system, and also spawn the search for 
alternatives. This ability even hurries ahead of free speech. qaul.net 
is therefore dedicated to this dimension of independence and the 
strengthening of the individual. This community project opens our eyes 
for a presence that becomes more global, but this presence brings us 
also more into line, and increases our dependencies. qaul.net inverts 
this perspective. It perceives from a subjective and specific position, 
it looks into the neighborhood and from their to the world.

The name qaul.net is a tribute to the Arab insurgents. The project 
works just like a group of protestors that discover their own action 
potential as a curious bright spot amidst huge seemingly immoveable 
power blocks.
