Description: |
    **qaul.net** is an internet independent ad-hoc wireless mesh-network suite,
    that allows everyday devices such as computers and smartphones
    to create a **decentralised, free network**,
    on which users can share files,
    have voice calls and text conversations,
    all in a single app.

    In addition to this, it provides a powerful service library,
    which enables others to write applications that communicate
    and interact with an existing qaul network.
