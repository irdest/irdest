[![Built with Nix](https://builtwithnix.org/badge.svg)](https://builtwithnix.org)

**qaul** is a decentralised networking project, aiming to create
easy-to-use solutions for ad-hoc wireless communication.  It supports
many common desktop operating systems (Linux, Windows, MacOS, BSD, …),
and Android mobile phones.  iOS support is on the roadmap.

**qaul** is both a cross-platform application, implementing
**messaging**, **filesharing**, and **voice calls**, but also a
**development toolkit** to create fully decentralised third-party
applications.

In order to be able to run on unpriviledged mobile platforms qaul
implements **decentralised routing protocols** and utilities entirely
in userspace.  The codebase is largely written in
[Rust](https://rustlang.org), with only a few compatibility components
being written in more platform specific languages.  All parts of the
project are contained in this repository.

Following is an overview of the available components.  Components have
additional information in their respective README files.

## Overview

Most traditional networking infrastructure (both the transmission
layer, as well as applications) operate in a centralised way.  Clients
connect to servers, and devices to towers.  This makes the
infrastructure vulnerable to attacks.  Natural disasters or opressive
governments can easily shut down communication for millions of people,
potentially putting them at risk, and slowing down or disrupting any
organisation or activist movement.

qaul aims to solve this issue by creating decentralised circuits
between devices directly.  These direct device-to-device connections
can be imperfect and unstable.  qaul's routing approach takes these
issues into account by caching undelivered messages, and carrying them
towards their destination until the receipient comes back online.

Routing in a qaul network is done via a user's ed25519 public keys,
creating a 32 byte large address space.  Connecting devices together
happens via channel-specific drivers (for example the tcp internet
overlay). Therefore when creating a circuit, roaming between different
connection types is normal, and no single technology has to work on
all possible devices.

[contributor manual].

## How to use

There's no single way to use qaul.  Various platforms support
different clients, and a qaul network can consist of many different
components interacting with each other.  To get started, check out the
[user manual]!
