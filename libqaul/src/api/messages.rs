    /// The Service API provides an interface to communicate with
    /// other users on a qaul network. These messages are relatively
    /// low-level, meaning that their payload (for example) is simply
    /// a `Vec`, and it's left to a service to do anything meaningful
    /// with it.
    ///
    /// However when users write text-messages to each other in
    /// qaul, these are being sent via the `messaging` service,
    /// which implements it's own `Message`, on top of `libqaul`. In
    /// that case a message is plain text and can have binary
    /// attachments.
    ///
    /// Underlying `libqaul`, the routing layer (`RATMAN`) uses the
    /// term Message to refer to the same concept as a Service API
    /// message, with some more raw data inlined, such as signatures
    /// and checksums. Fundamentally they share the same idea of what
    /// a payload or recipient is however, and payloads that are
    /// unsecured in a Service API message will have been encrypted by
    /// the time that `RATMAN` handles them.
